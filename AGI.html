<i>At The Asset Architects, we believe in fair, transparent, and ethical investment opportunities. Our Asset Growth Initiative (AGI) is designed for investors who want to grow their wealth through a Shariah-compliant, risk-sharing model without claiming ownership of the company.
</i>
<p>How It Works</p>


    <h3 style="text-align: center;">Investment Without Ownership:</h3>
    <ul> 
        Investors provide capital but do not hold any ownership, decision-making power, or control over the company's operations. They participate purely as financial partners.
    </ul>





    <h3 style="text-align: center;">Profit Sharing (15% of Companyâ€™s Profit):</h3>
    <ul> 
        If the company makes a profit, 15% of the total profit is allocated to investors. This means that the return is directly linked to the companyâ€™s performanceâ€”there are no fixed returns or guaranteed payouts.

</ul>
    
    
<h3 style="text-align: center;">Loss Sharing:</h3>
    <ul> 
        Since this is a fair and ethical investment model, investors must also bear the risk of loss. If the company incurs a loss, the investors will share it proportionally based on their invested amount.
    </ul>

    <h3 style="text-align: center;">Interest-Free & Transparent Transactions:</h3>
    <ul> 
        The initiative strictly follows interest-free (Riba-free) principles, ensuring that investments are used for real economic growth rather than speculative financial activities.
</ul>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">Annual Financial Reporting:</h3>
<ul>
    Investors receive detailed annual reports on the companyâ€™s financial performance, ensuring full transparency in profit distribution and financial management.
</ul>
