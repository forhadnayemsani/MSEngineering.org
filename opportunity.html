        Opportunity Zone â€“ Time-Bound, Shariah-Compliant Business Sessions
    </h2>
<div style="border: 1px solid #FFF; margin: 10px;padding:10px ;">
<i>Our Opportunity Zone offers investors a chance to participate in specially curated business sessions. Each session comes with its own profit distribution policy, explained in detail before the session starts.
</i>
<p>How It Works</p>


    <h3 style="text-align: center;">Specific Sessions:</h3>
    <ul> 
        We conduct defined sessions focused on particular business opportunities. Each session has a dedicated timeline, during which investments are open.
    </ul>





    <h3 style="text-align: center;">Pre-Session Disclosure:</h3>
    <ul> 
        Prior to each session, we provide a detailed circular explaining the profit distribution policy. This ensures that all investors understand the rules, including deadlines and terms, before committing funds.

</ul>
    
    
<h3 style="text-align: center;">Defined Deadlines:</h3>
    <ul> 
        Every session operates within a specified time window with clear deadlines. Investments outside this period will not be accepted, ensuring disciplined participation and project focus.
    </ul>

    <h3 style="text-align: center;">Profit Potential & Risk Sharing:</h3>
    <ul> 
        The sessions may offer opportunities for higher returns, with profits distributed according to the pre-disclosed policy. However, if the session incurs a loss, investors will bear the loss proportionally.
</ul>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">Shariah-Compliant Framework:</h3>
<ul>
    Shariah-Compliant Framework:
All aspects of the Opportunity Zone adhere strictly to Shariah law, ensuring that all business practices and profit-sharing arrangements are ethical and interest-free.
</ul>
